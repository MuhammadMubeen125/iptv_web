- [ ] Set up testing environment
- [ ] Implement unit tests for critical components
- [ ] Create E2E tests for payment flow
- [ ] Perform cross-browser testing
- [ ] Conduct accessibility audit

## Action Plan

### Immediate Next Steps (Week 1)
1. Complete the Billgang payment integration
2. Implement basic email notification system
3. Set up form handling for contact and demo requests

### Short-Term (Week 2-3)
1. Finish authentication and basic dashboard functionality
2. Complete content and copy for all pages
3. Begin testing payment flow

### Medium-Term (Week 4-5)
1. Implement SEO optimizations
2. Set up deployment configuration
3. Conduct QA testing

### Long-Term (Week 6+)
1. Performance optimization
2. Analytics integration
3. Create additional blog content

## Dependencies & Requirements

- Billgang API credentials (test and production)
- Email service API keys
- Payment gateway testing cards
- SSL certificate for production
- Domain name configuration

## Notes

- The manual fulfillment model means we don't need real-time activation, but email notifications are critical for admin awareness of new orders
- Consider implementing a simple admin notification system (email or messaging) for immediate alerts when new orders come in
- Prioritize the payment flow testing in a sandbox environment before going live
